# DiscordBot.py-API

###_**DISCLAIMER:**_ Currently, the code is just a direct copy of UnlockedBot, my specific implementation of the API. Once the API is feature-complete, I will redo this github page with documentation, instructions, unbranded files, etc.

Made using discord.py, the discordbot.py API is a completely expandable, drag-and-drop module-based discord bot. This is designed to be a single bot that can do anything that a user would want, simply by downloading modules and dropping them into a folder.
