## DiscordBot.py-API

Made using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), the discordbot.py API is a completely expandable, drag-and-drop module-based discord bot. This is designed to be a single bot that can do anything that a user would want, simply by downloading modules and dropping them into a folder.

If you would like to develop with this API, it is currently in a state that should be relatively stable. However, no warranty is guarenteed and abstraction changes as well as refactoring may require you to modify your module.  
Documentation is not yet provided.
